Use workbench wizard to quickly install a solid scripting environment using dayz workbench.  The video tut for it is here https://youtu.be/Uipgrm2ZQQQ

Workbenchwizard.exe needs to run in admin mode if you want it to create the links for you like in the video.  But if you don't want to run the exe in admin mode, which tbh is the better practice, I provided a linkall.bat file which will handle the linking (absent the cool GUI) without admin privileges.

As an alternative to running the workbenchwizard.exe, I have also provided the source code so you can  run "WorkbenchWizard.Package.ps1" by right clicking on it and selecting, run with powershell.

Also I added a standalone renaming tool that will rename the batch files so that they work with mods that you create.
